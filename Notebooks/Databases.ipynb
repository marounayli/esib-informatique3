    "## What are relational databases \n",
    "\n",
    "As the term suggests relational databases are first and foremost databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without technical knowledge, one could define a database as an abstract space to store and fetch data\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a database is defined as a collection of structured information that has a specific querying language for both READ and WRITE instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the information inside a database is structured, that means it follows a certain schema, plan, or method of design and implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practices in the lates 1950s to the 1970s led to the creation of a formal mathematical way to design a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "That model called <b> the relational model </b> is the product of the mathematical concept known as relational algebra, wich uses algebraic structures to define relationships and also provides a query language to read and update the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational algebra was founded by [Edgard F. Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will not be tackling the details of relational algebra, as there will be a course you will attend (if you're a CCE major) that will provide deep understanding of this concept.\n",

    "## Creating your first Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply speaking, a database schema defines the different relations and the relationships between them. A schema is usually defined in a formal language - SQL in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "All you have to do to create your relation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A schema can also be referred to as database in some terminologies, however a schema is a more accurate than as database can be confused with the database server itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are relations ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Relations are a set of what is called named attribute values. An attribute is a name paired with a domain (nowadays more commonly referred to as a type or data type).\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern database systems, a table is the physical representation of the relation. Named attribute values are the columns of that table, they have a name and a type associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concrete example:\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to create a simple yet rich example to learn more about relations\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to consider the following scenario: we are creating a social network application and we are in charge of creating the part related to posts and post comments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reasoning about the structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The most intuitive thing would be to create a relation that contains some basic information, for example we have the following *post* relation\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field Name  | Field Type  |\n",
    "| ----------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| Title       | varchar(100)|\n",
    "| Caption     | varchar(500)|\n",
    "| Image       | binary(1K)  |\n",
    "| CreatedAt   | Timestamp   |\n",
    "| SubmittedBy | varchar(500)|\n",
    "| Likes       | integer     |\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this structure, we can clearly see that we have a certain problem of identifying the post:\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we had the same post title, same caption and the same image submitted by two people with the username.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tuple in the relation, must be uniquely identified. If there is nothing natevily unique about the studied entity then we stumble upon the ID field.\n",
    "\n",
    "You, a student in USJ are identified by an ID, because no matter which angle you look at, there are nothing in your basic info that would make you uniquely identifiable...\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have the updated structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field Name  | Field Type  |\n",
    "| ----------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| ID          | integer (AT)|\n",
    "| Title       | varchar(100)|\n",
    "| Caption     | varchar(500)|\n",
    "| CreatedAt   | Timestamp   |\n",
    "| SubmittedBy | varchar(100)|\n",
    "| Likes       | integer     |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the comments we'll keep it simple, a post comment only contains text and is associated to a post:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field Name  | Field Type  |\n",
    "| ----------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| ID          | integer (AT)|\n",
    "| Content     | varchar(200)|\n",
    "| CreatedAt   | Timestamp   |\n",
    "| SubmittedBy | varchar(100)|\n",
    "| PostID      | integer     |\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that here we have added the PostID Field to indicate that this comment is mapped to a certain post\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To create these relation in actual tables we need to do that in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "   Create table post (\n",
    "       ID integer auto_increment primary key,\n",
    "       Title varchar(100),\n",
    "       Caption varchar(500),\n",
    "       CreatedAt timestamp,\n",
    "       SubmittedBy varchar(100),\n",
    "       Likes integer);\n",
    "       \n",
    "   Create table post_comment(\n",
    "       ID integer auto_increment primary key,\n",
    "       Content varchar(500),\n",
    "       CreatedAt timestamp,\n",
    "       SubmittedBy varchar(100),\n",
    "       PostID integer,\n",
    "       \n",
    "       Constraint FOREIGN KEY (PostID) REFERENCES post(ID) on DELETE CASCADE\n",
    "       );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to insert some records into the post table we can execute the SQL INSERT command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "    INSERT INTO post(Title,Caption,CreatedAt,SubmittedBy,Likes)\n",
    "    VALUES\n",
    "        ('Title1','Caption1','2022-01-01 00:00:00','User1',0),\n",

    "        ('Title6','Caption6','2022-01-01 00:00:00','User3',0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we did not manually add the ID of the post. We don't have to since we specified that the post table assigns automatically an Integer ID that starts at 1 and increments with each record inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also insert some content into the comments table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "    INSERT INTO post_comment(Content, CreatedAt, SubmittedBy,PostID)\n",
    "    VALUES\n",
    "        ('Content of comment related to post1', '2022-01-02 00:00:00', 'User1', 1),\n",
    "        ('Content of another comment related to post1', '2022-01-01 00:00:00', 'User2', 1),\n",
    "        ('Content of comment related to post2', '2022-01-01 00:00:00','User1', 2)\n",
