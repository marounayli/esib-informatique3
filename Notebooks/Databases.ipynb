    "## What are relational databases \n",
    "\n",
    "As the term suggests relational databases are first and foremost databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without technical knowledge, one could define a database as an abstract space to store and fetch data\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a database is defined as a collection of structured information that has a specific querying language for both READ and WRITE instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the information inside a database is structured, that means it follows a certain schema, plan, or method of design and implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practices in the lates 1950s to the 1970s led to the creation of a formal mathematical way to design a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "That model called <b> the relational model </b> is the product of the mathematical concept known as relational algebra, wich uses algebraic structures to define relationships and also provides a query language to read and update the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational algebra was founded by [Edgard F. Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will not be tackling the details of relational algebra, as there will be a course you will attend (if you're a CCE major) that will provide deep understanding of this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about the mathematics behind the relational model you can read the following books:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Database Design and Relational Theory - C.J. Date\n",
    "    <li> Usage-Driven Database Desgin - George Tillman\n",
