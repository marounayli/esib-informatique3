# esib-informatique3 
Repository for Jupyter notebooks for class notes


## Getting started

It is preferrable if you push to the repo using ssh, using https is not recommended by github and is really slow, as you have to provide your credentials on every action.


## Setting up your keys:

If you don't have an ssh key on your local machine connected to your github account, then follow these steps found at : [the following documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)


## Pushing new files or modifying existing ones :

<ul>
    <li> make sure you have the latest verison by pulling the origin: git pull
    <li> add the files you wanna update using: git add filename
    <li> push the change using git push
</ul>
